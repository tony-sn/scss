scss coding

Hi, my name is Tung

I have create a project to mock up Udemy website, to practice my new skill scss that I learn during the course. It's more convenient that css and assist me in organising my codes.

Udemy landing page would be one of the most challenging project that I have ever done, but it's modern site and up-to-date functions for an online learning website and  good for my learning.

Please feel free to use my codes as your preference, or you can inspect Udemy site, the original source that I am following.
